                <p>Money has evolved from barter systems to coins, paper currency, and now digital transactions. It
                    serves as a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange. The value of money is not
                    intrinsic but derived from collective trust and the stability of the economy backing it. Central
                    banks and governments play crucial roles in maintaining this value through monetary policies,
                    controlling inflation, and managing interest rates. Over time, shifts in the global economy, such as
                    digital currencies and decentralized finance, may redefine the concept and value of money.

        <h2>GMO Food</h2>

            <figcaption>
                <p>Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) foods involve the direct manipulation of an organism's DNA to
                    produce desired traits. This technology allows scientists to enhance crop yields, improve
                    nutritional content, and develop resistance to pests and diseases. GMOs have sparked debate:
                    proponents argue that they are essential for feeding a growing global population and combating
                    climate change, while critics raise concerns about potential health risks, environmental impact, and
                    the ethics of altering natural organisms. The regulatory landscape varies globally, with some
                    countries embracing GMOs and others imposing strict bans.

        <h2>The View of the World in 2100</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="../img/world2100.jpg" alt="The View of the World in 2100">
            <figcaption>
                <p> By 2100, the world could look vastly different from today due to technological advancements, climate
                    change, and societal transformations. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation could
                    revolutionize industries, reshape job markets, and alter daily life. Climate change may lead to more
                    extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and shifts in agricultural patterns, prompting a global
                    push toward sustainability and renewable energy. Population growth, particularly in urban areas, may
                    strain resources, necessitating innovative solutions for housing, food, and transportation. The
                    geopolitical landscape could also shift, with new global powers emerging and international relations
                    adapting to new realities. The world in 2100 could be one of both incredible opportunity and
                    unprecedented challenges, with humanity's response to these changes determining the future course of
                    civilization.
